            Cipher #11: Substitution Cipher <br>
            In cryptography, a substitution cipher is a method of encrypting by which units of plaintext are replaced 
            with ciphertext, according to a fixed system; the "units" may be single letters (the most common), pairs 
            of letters, triplets of letters, mixtures of the above, and so forth. The receiver deciphers the text by 
            performing the inverse substitution.<br><br>
            Substitution of single letters separately—simple substitution—can be demonstrated by writing out the alphabet 
            in some order to represent the substitution. This is termed a substitution alphabet. The cipher alphabet may 
            be shifted or reversed (creating the Caesar and Atbash ciphers, respectively) or scrambled in a more complex 
            fashion, in which case it is called a mixed alphabet or deranged alphabet. Traditionally, mixed alphabets may 
            be created by first writing out a keyword, removing repeated letters in it, then writing all the remaining 
            letters in the alphabet in the usual order. (Wikipedia)
