            Cipher #6: CT (Columnar Transposition) Cipher <br>
            In a columnar transposition, the message is written out in rows of a fixed length, and then
            read out again column by column, and the columns are chosen in some scrambled order. Both the 
            width of the rows and the permutation of the columns are usually defined by a keyword. For 
            example, the keyword ZEBRAS is of length 6 (so the rows are of length 6), and the permutation 
            is defined by the alphabetical order of the letters in the keyword. In this case, the order 
            would be "6 3 2 4 1 5". (Wikipedia)
