            Cipher #25: ROT13 Cipher <br>
            The ROT13 cipher is a substitution cipher with a specific key where the letters of the alphabet 
            are offset 13 places. I.e. all 'A's are replaced with 'N's, all 'B's are replaced with 'O's, and 
            so on. It can also be thought of as a Caesar cipher with a shift of 13. (Practical Cryptography)
