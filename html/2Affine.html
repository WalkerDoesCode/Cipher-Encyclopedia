            Cipher #2: Affine Cipher <br>
            The affine is a type of monoalphabetic substitution cipher, where each letter in an alphabet is mapped
            to its numeric equivalent, encrypted using a simple mathematical function, and converted back to a letter. 
            The formula used means that each letter encrypts to one other letter, and back again, meaning the cipher 
            is essentially a standard substitution cipher with a rule governing which letter goes to which. As such, 
            it has the weaknesses of all substitution ciphers. Each letter is enciphered with the function (ax + b) 
            mod 26, where b is the magnitude of the shift. (Wikipedia)
