            Cipher #28: Scytale Cipher <br>
            The scytale was an encryption device used by the Ancient Greeks and Spartans. It consisted of a 
            polygonal rod or cylinder, around which was wrapped a piece of parchment. The sender would write the 
            message along the faces of the rod as seen in the image below. When the parchment is removed from the 
            Scytale, it leaves a nonsensical message going down the strip (in the case below it would read "STSF...").<br><br>

            When the message is received, it is wrapped around a rod of the same size and shape as the original, 
            to reveal the original message. Clearly, you just need to get a rod of the same size, or try out a few 
            different ones to break this code. However, its importance lies in the fact that it is one of the first 
            uses of tools in Crytpography. (Crypto Corner)
