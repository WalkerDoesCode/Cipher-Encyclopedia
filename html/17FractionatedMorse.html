            Cipher #17: Fractionated Morse Cipher <br>
            The Fractionated Morse cipher first converts the plaintext to morse code, then enciphers fixed 
            size blocks of morse code back to letters. This procedure means plaintext letters are mixed into 
            the ciphertext letters i.e. one plaintext letter does not map to one ciphertext letter. This 
            makes it more secure than e.g. substitution ciphers, but it can still be broken with some effort. 
            One of the benefits of the Fractioned Morse cipher is that it can encipher spaces and punctuation 
            just as easily as letters. The ciphertext message will generally be of a similar length to the 
            plaintext message, but often will have a slightly different number of characters.<br><br>
            To pass an encrypted message from one person to another, it is first necessary that both parties have the 
            'key' for the cipher, so that the sender may encrypt it and the receiver may decrypt it. For the 
            Fractionated Morse cipher, the key is a mixed alphabet e.g. "ROUNDTABLECFGHIJKMPQSVWXYZ".<br><br>
