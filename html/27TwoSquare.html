            Cipher #27: Two Square Cipher <br>
            The two-square cipher is a polygraphic substitution cipher. The original plaintext is divided into 
            groups of a few letters. Then, each group is replaced by another previously determined group of 
            characters. The two-square cipher operates on groups of the size of two letters.<br><br>
            Before encryption one should prepare two tables, using words (or longer phrases) that are used as secret 
            keys. Both tables have dimensions of 5 by 5 letters and contain 25 letters of the Latin alphabet. The Latin 
            alphabet has 26 letters, so to create the table, one of the rare letters should be skipped (for example, x 
            or q), or the letters i and j should be treated as one letter as shown below:<br><br>

            <br>
            The tables should be placed side by side in such a way that lines of rows (or lines of columns) are aligned. 
            To perform encryption, as a next step, one should divide the plaintext into pairs. Each pair should consist 
            of two consecutive letters. If necessary, a rare letter may be appended to the original text (for example X 
            or Q). Then, one should find the first letter of each pair in the first table, and the second letter in the second 
            table. Then, one should create a rectangle that covers over two tables and has corners in cells determined 
            by the two letters. To encrypt those two letters, they have to be replaced by another two letters, that 
            are determined by two other corners of the rectangle. The same steps should be repeated for all plaintext 
            pairs. All letters should be replaced by letters chosen based on the tables.<br><br>
            If both letters in the currently encrypting pair are located in the same row (or, respectively, in the same 
            column), then a new pair should the same as the original one. It must by highlighted that one of the 
            weaknesses of the two-square cipher is that such a situation takes place for twenty percent of all 
            possible pairs of letters. (Crypto-It)
