            Cipher #30: Myszkowski Transposition Cipher <br>
            The Myszkowski Transposition Cipher is a variant of Columnar Transposition in the way it deals with 
            recurring letters in the keyword. It was proposed by Émile Victor Théodore Myszkowski in 1902. The 
            same methodology as for Columnar Transposition is used, where the plaintext is written out in rows 
            under the keyword. The only difference is that when there are repeated letters in the keyword, rather 
            than number them from left to right, you give all the same letters the same number. You then read 
            across columns which have the same number in the keyword. (Crypto Corner)
