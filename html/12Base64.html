            Cipher #12: Base 64 Cipher <br>
            In computer science, Base64 is a group of binary-to-text encoding schemes that represent binary data in an ASCII string format 
            by translating it into a radix-64 representation. The term Base64 originates from a specific MIME content transfer encoding. 
            Each Base64 digit represents exactly 6 bits of data. Three 8-bit bytes (i.e., a total of 24 bits) can therefore be represented 
            by four 6-bit Base64 digits.<br><br>
            The particular set of 64 characters chosen to represent the 64 digit-values for the base varies between implementations. The 
            general strategy is to choose 64 characters that are common to most encodings and that are also printable. This combination leaves 
            the data unlikely to be modified in transit through information systems, such as email, that were traditionally not 8-bit clean. 
            For example, MIME's Base64 implementation uses A–Z, a–z, and 0–9 for the first 62 values. Other variations share this property but 
            differ in the symbols chosen for the last two values; an example is UTF-7. (Wikipedia)<br><br>
