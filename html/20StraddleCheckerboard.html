            Cipher #20: Straddle Checkerboard Cipher <br>
            The key for a straddling checkerboard is a permutation of the alphabet e.g. 'fkmcpdyehbigqrosazlutjnwvx', 
            along with 2 numbers e.g. 3 and 7. A straddling checkerboard is set up something like this (using the key 
            information above): <br><br>

            The first row is set up with the first eight key letters, leaving two blank spots. It has no row label. 
            The second and third rows are labelled with whichever two digits didn't get a letter in the top row, and 
            then filled out with the rest of the key letters. Since there are 30 slots in our grid, and we missed two letters 
            in the first row, there will end up being two spare in the other rows. It doesn't matter where these spares go, 
            so long as sender and receiver use the same system. <br><br>
            To encipher, a letter on the top row is simply replaced by the number labelling its column. Letters on the other 
            rows are replaced by their row number, then column number. (Practical Cryptography)
