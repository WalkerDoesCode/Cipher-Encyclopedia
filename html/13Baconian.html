            Cipher #13: Baconian Cipher <br>
            The Baconian cipher is a substitution cipher in which each letter is replaced by a sequence of 5 characters. 
            Each letter is assigned to a string of five binary digits. These could be the letters 'A' and 'B', the numbers 
            0 and 1 or whatever else you may desire. <br><br>
            Given an encryption low key of "a" and an encryption high key of "b", this program uses the following encryption
            scheme that was listed on Practical Cryptography:<br><br>
