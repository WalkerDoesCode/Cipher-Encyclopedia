            Cipher #32: Morse Code Cipher <br>
            Morse Code, created by Samuel Morse, was designed to transmit letters across telegrams. When encrypting, only letters and numbers 
            will be encoded and the rest will be treated like spaces. When decrypting, only periods and hyphens will 
            be decoded and the rest will be treated like spaces. This web page uses International Morse Code with some additional 
            enhancements, but without support for foreign characters. It also is geared to help you decode Morse Code 
            snippets you find with the Reverse (flips the text) and Swap (exchanges periods and hyphens) links. (Rumkin)
