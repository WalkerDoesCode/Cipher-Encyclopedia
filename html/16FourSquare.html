            Cipher #15: Four Square Cipher <br>
            The four-square cipher uses four 5 by 5 matrices arranged in a square. Each of the 5 by 5 matrices contains 
            25 letters, usually the letter 'j' is merged with 'i' (wikipedia says 'q' is omitted, it is not very important 
            since both q and j are rather rare letters). In general, the upper-left and lower-right matrices are the 
            "plaintext squares" and each contain a standard alphabet. The upper-right and lower-left squares are the "ciphertext 
            squares" and contain a mixed alphabetic sequence. <br><br> 
            Below is an example of what these four square grids could look like: <br><br>

            1) Break up the plaintext into bigrams i.e. ATTACK AT DAWN --> AT TA CK AT DA WN. An 'X' (or some other character) may 
            have to be appended to ensure the plaintext is an even length. <br><br>
            2) Using the four 'squares', two plain alphabet squares and two cipher alphabet squares, locate the bigram to 
            encrypt in the plain alphabet squares. The first letter is located 
            from the top left square, the second letter is located in the bottom right square. <br><br>
            3) Locate the characters in the ciphertext at the corners of the rectangle that the letters in the bigram make. (Practical Cryptography)
