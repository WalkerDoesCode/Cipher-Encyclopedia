            Cipher #4: Railfence Cipher <br>
            In the rail fence cipher, the plain text is written downwards and diagonally on successive 
            "rails" of an imaginary fence, then moving up when the bottom rail is reached. When the top 
            rail is reached, the message is written downwards again until the whole plaintext is written 
            out. The message is then read off in rows. (Wikipedia)
