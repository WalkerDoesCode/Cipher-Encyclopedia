            Cipher #39: Transposition Period Cipher <br>
            Transposition cipher is the name given to any encryption that involves rearranging the plain 
            text letters in a new order. However, in the literature, the term transposition cipher is 
            generally associated with a subset: columnar transposition (or rectangular transposition) which 
            consists of writing the plain message in a table / grid / rectangle, then arranging the columns 
            of this table according to a defined permutation. The permutation key is a series of numbers 
            (often generated from a word) which indicates in which order to arrange the columns. (DCode)
