            Cipher #29: Permutation Cipher <br>
            The Permutation Cipher is another form of Transposition Cipher. It is similar to Columnar Transposition 
            in some ways, in that the columns are written in the same way, including how the keyword is used. However, 
            the Permutation Cipher acts on blocks of letters (the lengths of the keyword), rather than the whole 
            ciphertext. (Crypto Corner)
