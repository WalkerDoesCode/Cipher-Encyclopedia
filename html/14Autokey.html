            Cipher #14: Autokey Cipher <br>
            The Autokey Cipher is a polyalphabetic substitution cipher. It is closely related to the Vigenere cipher, 
            but uses a different method of generating the key. It was invented by Blaise de Vigen√®re in 1586, and is 
            in general more secure than the Vigenere cipher.<br><br>
            The 'key' for the Autokey cipher is a key word. e.g. 'FORTIFICATION' The Autokey cipher uses the 
            following tableau (the 'tabula recta') to encipher the plaintext: <br><br>

            To encipher a message, place the keyword above the plaintext. Once all of the key characters have been 
            written, start writing the plaintext as the key. Now we take the letter we will be encoding, 'D', and find it on the 
            first column on the tableau. Then, we move along the 'D' row of the tableau until we come to the column with the 
            'F' at the top (The 'F' is the keyword letter for the first 'D'), the intersection is our ciphertext character, 'I'. (Practical Cryptography)<br><br>
