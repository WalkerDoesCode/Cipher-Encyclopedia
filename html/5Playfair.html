            Cipher #5: Playfair Cipher <br>
            The Playfair cipher uses a 5 by 5 table containing a key word or phrase. Memorization of the 
            keyword and 4 simple rules was all that was required to create the 5 by 5 table and use the cipher.
            To generate the key table, one would first fill in the spaces in the table (a modified Polybius 
            square) with the letters of the keyword (dropping any duplicate letters), then fill the remaining 
            spaces with the rest of the letters of the alphabet in order (usually omitting "J" or "Q" to reduce 
            the alphabet to fit; other versions put both "I" and "J" in the same space). The key can be written 
            in the top rows of the table, from left to right, or in some other pattern, such as a spiral beginning 
            in the upper-left-hand corner and ending in the center. The keyword together with the conventions 
            for filling in the 5 by 5 table constitute the cipher key. To encrypt a message, one would break 
            the message into digrams (groups of 2 letters) such that, for example, "HelloWorld" becomes 
            "HE LL OW OR LD". These digrams will be substituted using the key table. Since encryption 
            requires pairs of letters, messages with an odd number of characters usually append an uncommon letter, 
            such as "X", to complete the final digram. The two letters of the digram are considered opposite corners 
            of a rectangle in the key table. To perform the substitution, apply the following 4 rules, in order, to 
            each pair of letters in the plaintext: <br><br>
            1. If both letters are the same (or only one letter is left), add an "X" after the first letter. Encrypt 
            the new pair and continue. Some variants of Playfair use "Q" instead of "X", but any letter, itself uncommon 
            as a repeated pair, will do. <br><br>
            2. If the letters appear on the same row of your table, replace them with the letters to their immediate 
            right respectively (wrapping around to the left side of the row if a letter in the original pair was on 
            the right side of the row). <br><br>
            3. If the letters appear on the same column of your table, replace them with the letters immediately below 
            respectively (wrapping around to the top side of the column if a letter in the original pair was on the bottom 
            side of the column).<br><br>
            4. If the letters are not on the same row or column, replace them with the letters on the same row respectively 
            but at the other pair of corners of the rectangle defined by the original pair. The order is important â€“ the 
            first letter of the encrypted pair is the one that lies on the same row as the first letter of the plaintext 
            pair. <br> <br>
