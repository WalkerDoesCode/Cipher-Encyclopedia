            Cipher #1: Caesar / Shift Cipher <br>
            It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is
            replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet. For example, 
            with a left shift of 3, D would be replaced by A, E would become B, and so on. (Wikipedia)
